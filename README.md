# Kingpin2.0-Project-1 - Drone Zone

Drone zone is a web application that allows drone enthusiasts to upload and share their drone photography with others.

The upload section is located on the left side of the page. Users are encouraged to include their name, email, location, as well as the photo they would like to share. When the submit button is clicked the information is sent to a firebase database. That information is then pulled back into the webpage as a dynamically generated content card located in the content section of the site. These cards are prepended into content section and bootstrap modals are utilized when the user clicks on the photo to view a larger version of it.

Future functionality:
-	Video Uploads
-	User Profile for public/private storage
-	Ability to follow other users
-	Live streaming
